## pure lua pdf page splitter 

As help material I used a PyPDF2 sources  
https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2 
and ISO32000
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format

Main function is split(). It returns array of blobs gotten from one splitted blob. 

Splitter is absolutlely not universal and tested only on LibreOffice and unknown scanner pdf docs.
